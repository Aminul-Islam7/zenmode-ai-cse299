# ZenMode

ZenMode is a context-aware focus assistant designed to help users maintain attention during work or study sessions. The system aims to detect moments of focus drift and gently guide users back into a focused state, promoting mindful and distraction-aware productivity. This project is being developed as part of the CSE299 course at North South University.
